= ZeroMQ Ruby Bindings

ZeroMQ http://www.zeromq.org/

Ã˜MQ looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that
carry whole messages across various transports like inproc, IPC, TCP, and multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N
with patterns like fanout, pubsub, task distribution, and request-reply.

== Example

  require "zmq"

  context = ZMQ::Context.new(1)

  puts "Opening connection for READ"
  inbound = context.socket(ZMQ::UPSTREAM)
  inbound.bind("tcp://127.0.0.1:9000")

  outbound = context.socket(ZMQ::DOWNSTREAM)
  outbound.connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:9000")
  p outbound.send("Hello World!")
  p outbound.send("QUIT")

  loop do
    data = inbound.recv
    p data
    break if data == "QUIT"
  end

== Example 2
  require 'zmq'

  ZMQ::Context.new do |ctx|
    ctx.socket(ZMQ::SUB) do |sock|
      sock.bind('ipc:///tmp/zmq.1')
      sock.setsockopt(ZMQ::SUBSCRIBE, 'sample')
      loop do
        msg = sock.recv
        puts msg
      end
    end
  end
